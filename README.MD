The rules are simple:
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

To start/reset a generation process, simply press the Start/Stop button on the bottom right.

> You can manipulate the generation by clicking on any field with your mouse
